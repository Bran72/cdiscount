        ## About
        
        Above to use this package, please make sure you have the 2 libs *(Requests & BeautifulSoup)* installed. If not, please run:
        
        ```
        $ cd cdiscount
        $ pip install requests BeautifulSoup4 waitress
        ```
        
        Also, install the script with pip:
        
        ```
        $ pip install dist/cdiscount-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl   
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### The website
        Yup. That's not because we're in Python that we don't have the right to a nice a friendly user-interface. <br />
        So thanks to the next few commands, we'll run a server:
        
        ```
        $ python website/website.py
        ```
        And yeah, as mentioned in your shell, you can access the website via: [http://0.0.0.0:8080](http://0.0.0.0:8080) :-)
        <br />
        
        ### The script
        
        Next you'll be able to use the `parse_price(sku)` method to check a product price.<br />
        For example:
        
        ```
        $ python
        >>> from cdiscount.price_parser import parse_price
        >>> 
        >>> sku = "del5397184246030" # your product identifier
        >>> 
        >>> parse_price(sku)
        1776.6
        ```
        
        ## Testing
        
        This project includes few tests maded with [unittest](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/unittest.html). If you want to run this tests, simply do the following:
        > **Warning:** Run this in the main 'cdiscount' path
        
        ```
